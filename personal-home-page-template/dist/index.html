        <p class="aboutMe">I have spent the last 15 years working in customer service, sales and complaint handling roles. I am now looking for a change of career and have recently developed an interest in learning to code.<br>I learned all about the <strong>great things</strong> I could achieve through <strong>Code Your Future</strong> from someone who had successfully completed the course and is now loving his new career in coding. <br>Whilst I've mostly enjoyed the jobs that I've had, none of them really felt like a career to me. To put it simply; I want to feel like I'm achieving more than I have done so far.<br>I'm excited by coding because the possibilities are endless and it can help me to develop the meaningful career that I have been looking for.</p>
      <h2 class="my-future">My Future</h2>
        <p class="my-future">By this time next year, I hope to have completed a nine month course with Code Your Future and have started my first full-time employed role in coding. <br>Looking further down the line, in five years time, I hope to have developed the skills needed to work for myself. <br>In doing this, I'll be able to live a more free life and take my work in coding with me, wherever I choose to visit around the world!</p>
